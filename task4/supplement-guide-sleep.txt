Introduction
Nearly twenty years ago, as a young pup researching weightlifting out of my dorm room, I suddenly reached my limit. I thought I knew everything about weights and nutrition (ha!) and it was time to move on to the next topic: sleep science. So I bought an accelerometer-equipped sleep watch on this cool new site called 'eBay".
Oh my. I was a mild data nerd before then, but the watch turned me into a level 10 nerd. When I got even a bit less sleep, it was highly correlated with lower test scores, more stress, and…gym plateaus! Sleep seemed to be more influential than how much protein I got, what my lifting routine was, and pretty much anything else.
Digging Deeper: Sleep tracking? There's an app for that
In the late 1990s, accelerometer-equipped watches became available for sleep tracking. They weren't used for clinical sleep assessment - for which dedicated home devices,clunkier but more accurate, had recently become available to physicians - but they did provide the curious average person with some sleep data.
Fast forward a couple decades, and now anyone with a smartphone can use its accelerometer to track sleep, using cheap or free apps. But are these apps accurate? Can they really tell you how much time you spend in the different stages of sleepor how efficient your sleep was? Well, according to a recent study…no, not really.Still, those apps might bring potential problems to your attention (e.g., if you learn that you get up at the same time every night, you can try to understand why). They may also, very simply, keep you invested in maintaining healthy sleep patterns.
There is anecdotal evidence that a smartphone will track your sleep more accurately if you strap it to your arm or leg rather than lay it on your bed (especially if your bed is of the memory-foam variety). But if you want better data, you can purchase a fitness device. Not all such devices will be equally accurate, however, and any study on a given device is likely to have been funded by the device's manufacturer.(Industry funding does notdisqualify a study, but an industry-funded study is less likely to get published if it doesn't produce favorable results.)
The problem
Lack of sleep can negatively affect every aspect of your life, including your general fitness. Lack of sleep impairs athletic performance, in both the short termand the long term, and it does so in several ways, with some more obvious than others:
Impaired skill acquisition. Your ability to build specific brain-muscle connections (for example, to play the violin or throw a ball accurately) decreases with sleep deprivation, possibly due to a decrease in myelin production.Moreover, to build the right brain-muscle connections, you need to repeat the right moves, a task that becomes harder if your focus is impaired.
Impaired focus.Problems in concentration affect not only mental tasks, such as taking an exam or planning a project, but also physical ones. You simply can't give your all if you're not really 'there" when you train or compete.
Increased inflammation.Not only does this lead to an increased risk of injury, but even low-level painwill worsen your mood, foster mental and physical fatigue (you'll tire out even sooner, at work and at play), and further impair your focus.
Impaired insulin signaling. This leads to impaired glucose metabolism.Glucose, also known as blood sugar, is a main source of energy; if you cannot burn this fuel efficiently, you'll tire sooner (and risk developing diabetes,to boot).
Impaired cardiovascular health. If you don't get enough sleep, you're at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease.Impaired glucose metabolism is one of the probable causes.
Impaired muscle gain. You've probably heard that 'you grow when you sleep". In truth, we're still not quite sure that more muscle is built during sleep than during waking hours, but we do know that lack of sleep impairs muscle gain.The reasons are complex; they include a decrease in testosterone productionand, as we mentioned, an increase in fatigue (if you can't exercise as hard, or as long, you limit your potential for muscle growth).
CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH
INFLAMMATION
Wow. Is that all? Not quite. In addition to a decrease in athletic performanceper se, lack of sleep also causes an increase in fat gain . And isn't that unfair? If you spend more time awake, shouldn't you burn more
calories? And isn't burning more calories what fat burning is all about? So why does study after study show that you gain fat as you lose sleep?The main reason is simple: as you sleep less, you eat more. Even partial sleep deprivation) can cause a 20% increase in voluntary energy intake.It also causes your body to burn less fat and more muscle (which is yet another reason why lack of sleep impairs muscle growth).Now I hope that all this bad news won't keep you awake at night, or I've just become part of the problem! There are two big reasons why people don't get enough sleep, and stress is one of them. The other reason is that many people simply don't schedule enough time for sleep on a daily basis, instead hoping to 'catch up" during the weekend (a strategy with very limited efficacy). Other reasons, which are less widespread but harder to address, include pain,sleep apnea, and the forms of insomnia not related to stress.
The solutions
So what can you do about it?Let's be blunt: all a supplement can do ishelp you fall asleep, help you stay asleep, and help you sleep better. No supplement is going to knock you out, and of course, no supplement will pack 8 hours of sleep into 5 hours.
If you want your sleep to improve, you'll have to work with your supplements, not against them. You won't like it, but here it is:
First, you need to schedule enough time for sleep each day.
Second, you should try going to bed at the same time every day, even during the weekend, because this habit both improves sleep quality and reduces sleep onset latency (i.e., the time it takes you to fall asleep).
Third, for at least 1 hour before bed, you need to relax and avoid sources of blue light.
Blue light (which is produced by most screens as well as by the sun) can keep you awake even after you turn it off; and even after you fall asleep, it can still reduce your body's production of melatonin, thus decreasing the quality of your sleep.
Effect of light on melatonin production
Reference: Kayumov et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2005.Because playing intense games and answering emails tend to stimulate your brain, those activities are less than ideal near bedtime. Still, if you really need to use your phone, tablet, or computer at night, consider using a program that reddens your screen light after sunset. Or, if you cannot easily adjust the color balance of your screen, start wearing blue-light-blocking glasses a couple of hours before bedtime.
Digging Deeper: What should you avoid doing before bed?
If you ask people what they'd like to do before bed, you might hear answers such as meditate, read a book, or share some special time with their partner. But in reality, texting, playing games, or working is becoming more prevalent by the year, to the probable detriment of sleep quality.Aside from fiendishly typing and checking social media, are there any other activities you should avoid to get a sound night's sleep?
Eating right before bed is often targeted as a sleep killer. But the evidence is more nuanced; in some people, consuming small amounts of food (such as a glass of milk or a small snack) can benefit sleep.Nighttime exercise is another frowned-upon activity, yet recent trialand surveyevidence has shown a potential influence on sleep.
As it stands, more than what your pre-bed activities are, what's likely to hurt your sleep at that time is excess light exposure. The bright lights of a gym will have this effect, but so will using a tablet - a light-emitting device - rather than reading a printed book.All set? Ok, after the eyes, let's focus on the ears. Noise can both reduce sleep quality and make it harder to fall asleep,so minimize the noise in your bedroom. If that doesn't suffice, get earplugs, but keep in mind that earplugs attenuate high frequencies more than they do low frequencies - they may protect you against cars honking, but not much against traffic rumble.
Noise is bad enough, but heat can be worse.A bedroom warm enough to raise your core temperature can impair sleep quality and even cause insomnia.Conversely, a bedroom cool enough to lower your core temperature (but not so chilly as to be uncomfortable) will help you fall asleep faster and enter the deeper stages of sleep sooner.An instinctive desire to reduce one's core temperature also explains why some people like to keep a foot outside the blanket (the hands and feet are especially good at dissipating body heat).
There you have it. If anything, supplementation should be considered a solution of last resort, reserved for people who cannot sufficiently improve their sleep through lifestyle changes. And even if supplements help you, do not feel that you have to take them daily: if their efficacy seems to wane as weeks go by, try taking them only 3 to 5 nights per week.
It may take you a couple of months to determine your optimal combination of supplements and a couple more months to ascertain your best supplementation schedule. Every few months afterward, consider pausing supplementation to determine whether your sleep quality has improved.

Disclaimer about supplement quality
We expect that readers will do their due diligence when choosing products. Depending on the manufacturer, supplements may have inaccurate labels (i.e., they contain too much or too little of the ingredients they claim, or in some cases, significant amounts of other ingredients not listed). They may also contain significant amounts of contaminants such as heavy metals or pesticides. It is also possible for supplements to contain ingredients that people are commonly allergic to, and it's important to be aware of the nonmedicinal ingredients as well. As a brief introduction to vetting manufacturers, we drew up a short list of steps you should take if a product has caught your interest.
Tip: Why don't you recommend brands or specific products?
For two reasons:
We don't test physical products. What our researchers do - all day, every day - is analyze peer-reviewed studies on supplements and nutrition.
We go to great lengths to protect our integrity. As you've probably noticed, we don't sell supplements or even show ads from supplement companies, even though either option would generate a lot more money than our Supplement Guides ever will - and for a lot less work, too.
If we recommended any brands or specific products, our integrity would be called into question, so… we can't do it.
Core Combo
Start with 0.5 mg (500 μg) ofmelatonin half an hour before bed. You can increase by 0.5 mg each week until you find the lowest effective dose that works, but do not exceed 5 mg (5,000 μg). Melatonin can also help in case of jet lag.
Tip: Try one combo alone for a few weeks
Taking too many supplements at once may prevent you from determining which ones are truly working. Start with just one of the combos suggested here for a couple of weeks before you consider making any modification, such as adding another supplement, altering a supplements dosage, or incorporating the supplements from an additional combo.
When adding another supplement to your regimen, be methodical. For example, you may wish to take all the supplements from two combos. Select the combo that you wish to try first and take this for a couple of weeks. Then, add one supplement from the second combo and wait another week to see how it affects you. Continue this process until you've added all the supplements you wish to.
If a supplement appears in two combos you wish to combine, don't stack the doses; instead, combine the ranges. For instance, if the range is 2-4 mg in one combo and 3-6 mg in the other, your new range becomes 2-6 mg. Always start with the lower end of the range - especially in this case, since the reason why one of the ranges has a lower ceiling in one combo may be due to a synergy with another supplement in the same combo. Reading through the full supplement entry may help you decide which dose to aim for, but if you're not sure, lower is usually safer.
Specialized Combos
For people with anxiety and intrusive thoughts
A healthy diet that provides sufficient nutrients and the aforementioned lifestyle changes are essential before taking more and more herbal supplements. If you have anxiety, it is highly recommended to seek treatment by a healthcare professional.
Once that is addressed, in addition to melatonin:
Take 80 mg of Silexan™ (a lavender oil preparation standardized for the active component linalool at 25%46% of total weight) 30-45 minutes before bed. After 2 weeks, if no benefit has been observed, the dose can be increased to 160 mg (this is the maximum dose). Lavender can also be used as aromatherapy but is less reliable than the oral preparation.
If lavender oil proves insufficient on its own:
Add ashwagandha at a dose of 250 mg/day, split between two doses in the morning and evening (i.e., two doses of 125 mg each), and then increase to 600 mg/day if sleep doesn't improve noticeably after 2 weeks.
If the combination of lavender oil and ashwagandha proves to be insufficient on its own:
Take 600 mg of Melissa officinalis, powder on the first day, and slowly increase to 1,200 mg by the end of the first week. If that amount proves to be insufficient, higher doses may be helpful, but at this point, it is important to note that herbs can interact negatively with each other and with medications, and the more you take of the aforementioned herbs, the greater the theoretical risk becomes.
What has changed since the last time?
It should be noted that we changed the names of our ranking categories. 'Core" (the highest) is now 'primary"; 'primary" is now 'secondary"; and 'secondary" is now 'promising". These changes have already been implemented for some guides, but this is the first update to the Sleep Guide that uses this new terminology. For example, if it was a core supplement in the previous issue and now it's a secondary supplement in this issue, we'll say that it was a primary supplement in the previous issue and is now a secondary supplement.
Added:
L-theanine
Ashwagandha
L-tryptophan
Changed ranking:
Melatonin
Downgraded from primary to secondary. Although it is highly likely that melatonin can have a positive effect on sleep, the actual effects are generally small, and it may not help in some contexts.
Magnesium
Downgraded from secondary to unproven. Although the mechanistic plausibility is very high, and evidence is supportive, magnesium still has insufficient research according to our new standards.
Glycine
Downgraded from promising to unproven. Similar story to magnesium.
Valerian
Downgraded from promising to unproven. Although it is mechanistically plausible, the evidence is heavily mixed, and the best evidence generally suggests that if there is an effect, it is a small and unreliable one. Participants in studies do report better subjective sleep quality after taking it, but objective sleep measures don't appear to be convincingly improved.
Outcomes/methods glossary
Sleep (onset) latency: the amount of time it takes to fall asleep after laying down with the intention to sleep imminently.
Sleep efficiency: the percentage of time spent sleeping while in bed.
Sleep duration: the amount of time spent sleeping
Sleep quality: can refer to a number of different measures of sleep, especially how restful sleep is.
Actigraphy: a method of objectively measuring activity during sleep using a device worn on the wrist.
Primary Supplements
There aren't any supplements that we know of that have a considerable benefit, a high degree of evidence, and are broadly applicable. The secondary and promising supplements in this guide either lack robust evidence or are more likely to have modest effects on average.
Secondary Supplements
Lavender
What makes lavender a secondary supplement
Lavender (Lavandula) is used in aromatherapy for its relaxing scent. Because of the difficulty of blinding in aromatherapy studies, a lot of the evidence for lavender's effects stems from lower-quality studies, but newer studies have examined oral supplementation to treat anxiety.
Intrusive thoughts can increase the time it takes to fall asleep; lavender can reduce anxiety,promote relaxation, and have a calming effect on the mind.Lavender may also improve sleep quality,and alleviate insomnia,though more research is needed to determine the mechanism behind this effect. Similarly, more research is needed to confirm whether lavender and lemon balm are synergistic.
Studies on oral supplementation are more recent, and most of them used a proprietary lavender extract. In people with anxiety, Silexan™ was shown to alleviate anxietyand improve sleep quality and duration.Melatonin
What makes melatonin a secondary supplement
Melatonin is a hormone involved in the circadian rhythm (which dictates sleeping and waking cycles). As you wake up in the morning, melatonin levels go down, while at night, or if you dim the lights, melatonin production increases.
Digging Deeper: Variation in melatonin and cortisol throughout the day
Your circadian rhythm doesn't exist in a vacuum - it's influenced by external cues, which are referred to as zeitgebers (German for 'time givers"). Light is one of these zeitgebers. It impacts our circadian rhythm through its interaction with blue light receptors in the retina and the neural pathways that they influence.
Melatonin is one of the primary controllers of our body's circadian rhythm and is produced in the brain, specifically in the pineal gland in the absence of blue-wavelength light (shown below).Therefore, the production of melatonin can be disrupted by exposure to artificial light after sunset, leading to disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep problems.Effect of light on melatonin production
Reference: Kayumov et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2005.When administered as a supplement, melatonin can induce phase shifts in the circadian timing system and advance sleep onset.It can also reduce core body temperature, which encourages sleep. Consequently, oral melatonin most notably improves sleep onset latency in people with primary (i.e., a sleep disorder not caused by medical or psychiatric conditions or substance abuse) and secondary sleep disorders.However, although a statistically significant effect of melatonin is consistently observed across different populations, it's unclear whether this reduction in sleep onset latency is clinically meaningful because most reviews on the topic report an improvement in the range of about 3-15 minutes.For other sleep outcomes, melatonin supplementation has been found to improve overall sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (-1.24 points on average) in adults with various diseases.Further analysis revealed that although the effect was significant in people with respiratory or metabolic diseases or sleep disorders, it was nonsignificant in people with neurodegenerative diseases and other conditions.
Evidence also suggests that melatonin may increase total sleep time, but this effect is inconsistent. In studies that have reported an increase in total sleep time, the results have varied from around 7 to 50 minutes, depending on the population studied and how the outcome was measured (i.e., subjective measures like questionnaire vs. objective measures like polysomnography).Improvements appear to be more likely and of a larger magnitude in the context of secondary insomnia compared to primary insomnia.Promising Supplements
Ashwagandha
What makes ashwagandha a promising supplement
Ashwagandha Is an herb found across India and South Asia and has a rich history of use in Ayurveda as an adaptogen (i.e., herbs that improve the response to stress) and for treatment of a variety of ailments. Today, it is most widely known for its antianxiety effects, and emerging evidence suggests that it could be useful for improving sleep as well.
Although the exact mechanism by which ashwagandha improves sleep is currently unknown, one study in mice suggested that it may induce sleep by acting on the GABA receptor,and another reported that triethylene glycol could be the active sleep-inducing component of ashwagandha.Several trials have assessed the efficacy of ashwagandha to improve outcomes related to sleep quality, featuring different populations and measurements, but the results have been relatively consistent across the board. Ashwagandha improved subjective sleep quality measured on a 7-point Likert scale in adults with 'good sleep" at baseline,adults with 'poor sleep" and elevated stress levels at baseline,and older adults (ages 65-80) with 'poor" sleep at baseline.The effects of ashwagandha on sleep quality have also been investigated using more objective measures (i.e., actigraphy). In people with diagnosed insomnia and mild to moderate anxiety, ashwagandha has been shown to improve various measures of sleep quality, including greater increases in sleep efficiency as well as decreases in sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset compared to placebo.Additionally, ashwagandha was found to prolong total sleep time, boost sleep efficiency, and reduce sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset in people with nonrestorative sleep.Collectively, the available evidence suggests that ashwagandha has a medium positive effect on overall sleep, sleep onset latency, and sleep efficiency and a small positive effect on total sleep time and wake after sleep onset, with larger effects in people with diagnosed insomnia.As a result of a small sample size, heterogeneity in the baseline sleep quality of participants, and the use of objective measures of sleep quality in only 3 trials, ashwagandha is a promising supplement for improving sleep quality, but more research is needed to draw strong conclusions about its magnitude of effect in specific populations.
Melissa officinalis
What makes Melissa officinalis a promising supplement
Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) appears to have a meaningful effect on anxiety, with the current evidence suggesting a notable reduction.Anxiety is a major contributor to sleep difficulties, prolonging the amount of time it takes to fall asleep and causing excessive waking.
The number of trials evaluating its effects on sleep is still small, but the 4 available trials show consistent benefits to overall sleep quality, and 1 trial demonstrated the ability to reduce the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep onset latency).Only one of the trials was in participants with clear sleep disturbances not related to a parent condition, so there's very little evidence to support it for general insomnia, but the
research that we have looks promising, especially for people with anxiety-influenced sleep issues.
Unproven Supplements
Glycine
What makes glycine an unproven supplement
Glycine is an amino acid that's most prominent in collagen, but it is used in many other proteins and biological functions. With relevance to sleep, it acts as a neurotransmitter to NMDA receptors, which can lead to vasodilation and a reduction in body temperature, thus facilitating better sleep.In one randomized, single-blind crossover trial, 11 healthy participants took 3 grams of glycine at 1 hour before bedtime or a placebo for two nights and underwent sleep testing.The participants generally reported greater subjective sleep satisfaction, with less difficulty getting to sleep, less time awake and more time sleeping, though the subjective questionnaire appeared to be limited by selective reporting. The researchers did find an improvement in sleep onset latency, though not in time until REM sleep or sleep architecture overall. There was a reduction in daytime sleepiness, but it was not statistically significant for most time points, and there may have been some small cognitive improvements. Overall, this study should be considered very preliminary.
In a randomized, double-blind crossover trial, 19 participants also took 3 grams of glycine or placebo before bedtime for 4 days and experienced improvements in fatigue and subjective sleep satisfaction when taking glycine, but this trial was quite preliminary as well.Finally, in a randomized, single-blind crossover trial, 10 participants underwent partial sleep restriction (25% lower than their usual sleeping time).When taking glycine, the participants reported less fatigue and sleepiness (the latter was not statistically significant, however). There were some possible improvements in cognitive function, but the only statistically significant finding was improvement in reaction time on the psychomotor vigilance test on both testing days. The researchers also performed a rat study and found higher nighttime plasma melatonin levels in rats that took glycine.
In summary, glycine looks promising, but the amount and quality of the research we currently have is insufficient, and it remains unproven.
Magnesium
What makes magnesium an unproven supplement
Magnesium is an essential dietary mineral, and is the second most prevalent electrolyte in the human body. It is a cofactor for over 300 enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in the brain by controlling neuron excitability. Evidence pertaining to the efficacy of magnesium supplementation for improving sleep
quality is scarce, but mechanistically, low magnesium levels can lead to abnormal neuronal excitation (i.e., cells are activated during periods when they are not intentionally activated) and subsequently impair sleep. It's speculated that magnesium's role in regulating sleep is related to its ability to act as an antagonist and agonist of the NMDA and GABA systems.Most people do not consume enough magnesium, and this is especially true in Western countries where diets are rich in refined foods that are poor in magnesium. In older adults, the risk of magnesium deficiency is enhanced, not only due to alterations in food choices that lead to a reduced intakebut also as a product of reduced intestinal uptake and increased urinary excretion of magnesium.Additionally, a variety of medications (e.g., diuretics, proton pump inhibitors) can exacerbate magnesium losses, and it is common for older adults to take multiple medications to manage their health. As a consequence, older adults have been the population of interest for use of supplemental magnesium to improve sleep quality.
Collectively, very limited evidence suggests that magnesium supplementation may have a small positive effect on sleep onset latency (-17 minutes) in older adults.Also, one study reported that magnesium supplementation improved slow-wave sleep.However, it's critical to highlight that the studies conducted so far have been low quality and at moderate to high risk of bias.
As it stands, there is insufficient evidence to support magnesium as a sleep supplement. Nevertheless, magnesium is very cheap and widely available, and it is lacking in the average diet. For these reasons, if magnesium intake through foods is insufficient, supplementation may be recommended. Subjective improvements in sleep quality as a result may be a bonus. But for people with sufficient magnesium levels who consume a magnesium-rich diet, supplementing with magnesium is unlikely to improve sleep quality.
Tip: Who is more likely to have low magnesium levels?
Older people, because they tend to have relatively low magnesium intakesand may absorb less during digestion.People who sweat a lot, because magnesium is lost through sweat. Athletes participating in sports requiring weight control may be especially vulnerable.
People with type 2 diabetes, because according to estimatest for all adult ages in developed countries, hypomagnesemia affects less than 15% of healthy people but up to 50% of people with type 2 diabetes.Lemon Verbena
What makes lemon verbena an unproven
supplement
Lemon verbena is a flowering plant native to South America that is known for its lemon-like scent and flavor. Research suggests that it may have relaxing and antianxiety effects due to its ability to affect levels of neurotransmitters, endocrine hormones, and calcium channels in the brain.Three randomized trials have evaluated the effects of oral supplementation with lemon verbena on sleep quality, each with positive and promising results.However, more research is needed before we can have confidence that the effects are reliable and potent enough to warrant supplementation.
L-Theanine
What makes L-theanine an unproven supplement
Theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, regulates neurotransmission, and the results are often a reduction in stress and increase in relaxation.Because stress is a common cause of impaired sleep, theanine may be of use for sleep disorders.
However, the evidence is simply too preliminary to declare theanine an effective method of improving sleep quality. Three randomized trials have been conducted, and overall, they suggest a modest benefit to overall sleep.However, the trials weren't specifically designed to properly test theanine for improving sleep, and the overall evidence remains weak. There are 2 supportive open-label studies, but they don't add very much to the evidence due to their nonrigorous designs.Tryptophan
What makes tryptophan an unproven supplement
L-Tryptophan is an essential amino acid found in meat, dairy, some seeds and nuts, fish, green leafy vegetables, and eggs. Given its important role in the production of serotonin and melatonin - compounds that are essential for the body's sleep-wake cycle - tryptophan has been studied as a potential therapeutic for improving sleep quality. However, the evidence from the available randomized controlled trials examining these potential effects have produced mixed results.
More specifically, according to the results of a 2021 meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials involving 135 adults, supplementation with L-tryptophan improved wake time after sleep onset by around 1 minute, but failed to improve total sleep time, sleep latency (the time it takes a person to fall asleep), or sleep efficiency (the percentage of time spent asleep while in bed).It's worth noting that, in the aforementioned meta-analysis, L-tryptophan supplementation improved sleep latency (by around 50 seconds) and sleep efficiency (by around 1.6%) in sensitivity analyses that removed one trial conducted in participants without insomnia. These results suggest that supplementation with L-
ryptophan is more likely to improve sleep quality in individuals with insomnia.
With the above said, the size of the potential effect seems to be very small. It's also worth keeping in mind that these results were based on only a few small trials (3-4 in the main analyses and 2 in the sensitivity analyses). For these reasons, tryptophan is considered an unproven supplement.
Valerian
What makes valerian an unproven supplement
The root of valerian (Valeriana officinalis) has a long history of use as a treatment for insomnia and was one of the first sleep aids on the market. However, the available randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness of valerian for improving sleep have produced mostly mixed results.
More specifically, a 2015 meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials reported no effects of valerian on sleep latency (the time it takes a person to fall asleep), duration, efficiency, or quality.Most of the trials included in the meta-analysis used 400-600 mg of valerian root extract taken 1 hour before sleep. Similarly, a 2010 meta-analysis found no effects of valerian on sleep latency or sleep quality measured using a visual analogue scale.However, when the researchers examined dichotomous sleep quality (where participants were asked whether valerian improved their sleep quality or not), they found that participants taking valerian were 37% more likely to report improved sleep quality compared to participants taking a placebo. It's worth noting, though, that when this analysis was restricted to high-quality trials, the results became statistically nonsignificant.
In all, it may be the case that differences in the formulation of the supplement may affect its efficacy. This idea is supported by the results of a 2020 meta-analysis, which found that valerian whole root, but not valerian root extract, improved subjective sleep quality.However, it should be kept in mind that only 4 trials were included in this analysis.
Inadvisable Supplements
Caffeine
What makes caffeine an inadvisable supplement
Caffeine's primary mechanism of action, shown in the figure below, is interference with the effects of a molecule called adenosine.Adenosine promotes sleepiness by binding to certain receptors in the brain and interferes with the release of neurotransmitters that are associated with wakefulness, such as dopamine. Caffeine disrupts this process by preventing the binding of adenosine to its receptors, thus allowing the normal release of neurotransmitters associated with wakefulness.
Reference: Ferré. J Neurochem. 2008.People with a caffeine tolerance may still be able to fall asleep after ingesting caffeine, but this stimulant will still negatively affect sleep onset latency and sleep quality.Caffeine should not be consumed before sleep even by the most veteran coffee drinkers. Although some studies suggest that caffeine paired with 15-30minute 'power naps" can benefit alertness more than caffeine or naps alone, this benefit does not extend to longer sleep durations because caffeine will cause cortisol levels to rise after about 30 minutes.
Effects of caffeine on cortisol levels
Reference: Lovallo et al. Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1996.You might already be consuming more caffeine than you think. When calculating daily caffeine intake, consider all beverages, foods, and supplements consumed. Bear in mind that caffeine can be 'hidden" in a product - for instance, if 'guarana seeds" is listed on a label, remember that those are richer in caffeine than coffee seeds.
Avoid caffeine at least 6 hours before bed.
Stimulants
What makes stimulants an inadvisable supplement
People with sleep issues or those trying to improve sleep quality should be aware of the stimulants they may be taking (supplement or drugs) and when they take them.
If taking a stimulant, respect the recommended dosage. Be aware that most fat burners, preworkout supplements, energy drinks, or other products marketed at 'energy-boosting" are likely to contain stimulants, such as caffeine or synephrine. Be especially careful when taking several such products because they may have cumulative or even synergistic effects (and side effects).
As a general rule of thumb, avoid taking any stimulants at least 6 hours before bed.
